# Guidelines

This isn’t a typical component library. It’s a foundation for building fast, accessible, and maintainable websites using web fundamentals.

These principles guide how components are built and maintained:

1. **🧱 Built on Web Fundamentals** — Accessible, semantic HTML, vanilla CSS, and JavaScript only when absolutely needed.
2. **🚀 Bleeding Edge Performance** — Built for the fastest delivery possible: static-rendered, minimal payloads, zero waste.
3. **🧩 Modular by Design** — Small, focused components that can be combined to create anything.
4. **✏️ Controlled Editing** — Developers give editors the right amount of control to create without breaking consistency.
5. **🎨 Unbranded & Adaptable** — Ships without visual opinion, making it fast to restyle, rebrand, and align with any design direction.

## Components

Components are focused, reusable UI pieces that combine to create larger sections.

They should stay minimal, consistent, and easy to maintain.

Components are grouped by purpose:

- **Building Blocks** — Foundational UI components designed for reuse within larger structures.
- **Page Sections** — Full-width sections used to assemble complete page layouts.
- **Navigation** — Components that facilitate movement throughout the site, such as headers, menus, and footers.
