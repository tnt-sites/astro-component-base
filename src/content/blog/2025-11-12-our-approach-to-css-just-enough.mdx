We rely on modern CSS features like custom properties, scope, and container queries because that's the direction the web has already moved. No massive utility classes. No huge reset layers. Just thoughtful, readable styles that are easy to override or extend. It keeps the bundle lean and keeps your mind clear.

Custom properties give us flexibility without complexity. We can define design tokens once and use them throughout the stylesheet. Colors, spacing, typography scales, all become consistent and easy to update. When you need to change a color across the entire site, you update one custom property instead of searching through hundreds of class names. This approach scales naturally as your design system grows.

Here's how we use custom properties:

```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #0066cc;
  --spacing-md: 1.5rem;
  --font-size-lg: 1.25rem;
}

.button {
  background-color: var(--color-primary);
  padding: var(--spacing-md);
  font-size: var(--font-size-lg);
}
```

Change the color once, it updates everywhere. No searching, no replacing, just one update.

Scoped styles keep components isolated without requiring complex build processes. When styles are scoped to a component, you can be confident that changes won't affect other parts of the site. This isolation makes it safe to modify styles without worrying about unintended side effects. You can experiment with component styles knowing that the changes are contained.

Container queries bring responsive design to the component level. Instead of relying solely on viewport width, components can adapt based on their container's size. This means a card component can have different layouts depending on whether it's in a narrow sidebar or a wide main column. The component becomes truly flexible, adapting to its context rather than just the screen size.

Thoughtful, readable styles prioritize clarity over cleverness. When you read the CSS, you can understand what it does without deciphering complex selectors or obscure techniques. This readability makes styles easier to maintain because you can see the intent behind each rule. Future you will thank present you for writing CSS that tells a clear story.

The lean bundle comes from shipping only what's needed. There's no massive framework to load, no utility classes you'll never use, no reset styles that override browser defaults you actually want. Every line of CSS serves a purpose, which means every line contributes to the final design. This efficiency keeps load times fast and keeps the codebase manageable.

Keeping your mind clear is about reducing cognitive load. When styles are organized logically and written clearly, you don't have to remember complex naming conventions or hunt through layers of abstraction. You can focus on styling your components instead of fighting with the CSS architecture. This clarity makes the styling process feel natural and enjoyable.
