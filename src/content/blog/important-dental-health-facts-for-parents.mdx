Ensuring your child has a healthy smile involves more than just regular brushing. As a parent, understanding the importance of children’s dental health is critical for helping them learn lifelong oral hygiene habits. Continue reading to find five crucial facts every parent should know to help their child succeed in matters of [dental health](https://www.bloomkidsdentist.com/minimally-invasive-dentistry.html).

## 1\. Early Dental Visits are Important

Many parents believe that dental visits aren't necessary until a child has a full set of teeth. However, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends dental visits much earlier. Children should have their first dental visit by their first birthday or within six months of getting their first tooth. These early visits help detect dental health issues early and create a positive relationship between your child and their dentist.

## 2\. Baby Teeth Matter

It's easy to think that baby teeth don't require much attention since they'll eventually fall out. However, baby teeth play a huge part in your child's oral development. They help with proper chewing and speech and act as placeholders for permanent teeth. Neglecting baby teeth can lead to cavities, which may cause pain and infections that affect the growth of permanent teeth.

## 3\. Diet Affects Dental Health

What your child eats and drinks has a significant effect on their dental health. Sugary snacks and drinks, including juice and soda, can lead to tooth decay and gum disease. Try to encourage a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, dairy, and whole grains. While there’s no harm in the occasional treat or sugary drink, they shouldn’t consume them excessively.

## 4\. Fluoride Treatments are Excellent for Dental Health

Fluoride is a mineral that helps strengthen tooth enamel and prevent cavities. It’s a fairly common mineral in tap water as well as toothpaste and natural mouthwash brands. If you’re concerned about the potential for cavities, your dentist can also provide fluoride treatments for added strength.

## 5\. Proper Brushing and Flossing Techniques Matter

Teaching your child the correct way to brush and floss is an often overlooked component of their dental health. Kids should use a pea-sized amount of toothpaste and a soft-bristled toothbrush to brush their teeth twice a day for two minutes each time. Many children don’t develop the coordination needed to brush and floss correctly until around age 7 or 8. So, it’s best that you supervise their routine to ensure thorough cleaning.

By keeping these facts in mind, you can help ensure your child develops healthy dental habits that last a lifetime. Early dental care, proper nutrition, and regular checkups are key to keeping your child's smile bright and healthy!
