Developer experience isn't about having the most tools. It's about having the right ones. This starter gives you a clear file structure, then gets out of your way. No complex build pipelines to debug. No framework abstractions to learn. Just a straightforward setup that lets you focus on building instead of configuring.

Every tool you add requires mental space. You need to remember its configuration, understand its quirks, and keep up with its updates. Good developer experience recognizes that simplicity has value. When you choose tools thoughtfully, you create a workflow that supports your productivity rather than demanding constant attention.

Simplicity is intentional constraint. When you have fewer moving parts, you have fewer things that can break. When your file structure is predictable, you don't waste mental energy remembering where things go. When your build process is transparent, debugging becomes straightforward. These small wins compound throughout your day. The time you save on configuration is time you can spend solving actual problems.

  This framework has completely changed the way we build. The sites come together fast, they run
  even faster, and the whole process feels effortless. I couldn't be happier with the results.

The best developer experience feels invisible. You shouldn't have to think about how to structure your components or where to put your styles. The patterns should be obvious enough that new team members can contribute without a week of onboarding. When someone opens your codebase for the first time, they should be able to navigate it intuitively. This is about creating clarity that scales with complexity.

Real developer experience improvements show up in the moments between coding. It's the confidence of knowing exactly where to find that utility function. It's the ease of working with familiar patterns that make sense. It's the satisfaction of shipping features smoothly. These aren't flashy metrics you can put on a slide deck, but they're the difference between a frustrating day and a productive one.

The philosophy behind good developer experience is simple: respect the developer's time and attention. Every abstraction should justify its existence. Every tool should solve more problems than it creates. Every convention should make the codebase easier to understand. When you focus on what actually helps people build better software, you end up with something that feels almost boring, and that's exactly the point.
