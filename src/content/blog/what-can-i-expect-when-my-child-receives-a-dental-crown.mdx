If your child needs a [dental crown](https://www.bloomkidsdentist.com/restorative-care.html), you may be wondering what it involves. While it might sound like a big deal, modern dentistry has made this process incredibly streamlined, comfortable, and successful - even for children! That said, it’s still normal to have questions about what the appointment will look like and how you can ensure your child is adequately prepared. Keep reading to learn a little more about what to expect as you help your child navigate this process.

## How Will My Child’s Dentist Prepare Their Tooth for a Crown?

Your child’s dentist will prioritize their comfort above all else, and in many cases, a local anesthetic is used to numb the tooth and surrounding gums. They will also likely be sedated to ensure further comfort as well as compliance; in fact, they won’t remember much about the appointment at all!

After their mouth has been numbed and they’re comfortable, the tooth can be prepared. Any decayed or damaged portions of the tooth are carefully removed, and it’s then cleaned out to ensure it is thoroughly disinfected and free of any lingering bacteria. If there are any empty spaces, they can be filled, and the tooth’s surface is also smoothed to ensure the crown fits snugly.

Once the tooth is ready, the crown is placed over it and the fit is checked. The crown itself will be made from a durable, natural-looking material such as zirconia or a special composite resin, meaning it will look, feel, and function exactly like your child’s tooth. It’s finally secured using a special adhesive, your child’s bite will be checked, and any last-minute adjustments will be made.

## How Can I Help My Child Through This Process?

Your child’s mouth may feel a little numb following their appointment, and it’s best if you have them avoid eating any hard or sticky foods until the numbness wears off. Ideally, they should stick to soft or liquid foods for the remainder of the day, just to be safe. Some mild soreness is normal, but it should fully fade within a day or two.

Above all else, let your child know that things are going to be okay! The crown lets them keep their tooth, which is always a preferred outcome. If your child’s dentist has recommended a dental crown, rest assured that the procedure is simple, effective, and designed with their comfort in mind!
