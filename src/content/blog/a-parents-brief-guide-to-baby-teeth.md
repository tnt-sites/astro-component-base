One of the most exciting milestones in [your child's dental development](https://www.bloomkidsdentist.com/preventive-dentistry.html) is the arrival of their first tooth! Baby teeth, also called primary teeth, play an important role in helping children chew, speak, and smile with confidence. They also hold space for the permanent teeth that will come in later. Knowing when to expect baby teeth to appear--as well as knowing when they’ll eventually fall out--can help you feel more prepared for each stage and assist your child along the way. Here’s what you need to know.

## When Do Baby Teeth Start to Come In & Fall Out?

Most babies get their first tooth between 6 and 10 months of age, and it’s usually the lower front teeth that make their appearance before the others. From there, the rest tend to arrive in pairs over the next couple of years; this process is known as teething. The upper front teeth come next, followed by the teeth beside them, then the first molars in the back. The canines usually appear around the toddler years, and the final set of baby molars typically arrives last, at age 3. By then, most children have a full set of 20 baby teeth!

Around age 6, those same front teeth that came in first are often the first of the baby teeth to fall out. Over the next several years, the rest gradually loosen and are replaced by the emerging adult teeth. The lateral incisors, canines, and molars all follow, and by the early teen years, most children will have 28 permanent teeth in place--the last 4, the wisdom teeth, normally appear much later, during the late teens or early 20s.

## How Can I Help My Child’s Growing Smile?

Although they don’t stick around forever, baby teeth play an important role. They allow children to eat comfortably, speak with confidence, and guide adult teeth into their proper positions. Protecting them with good brushing habits and regular checkups gives your child a strong start toward lifelong oral health!

As soon as the first tooth arrives, it's time to start caring for it, and a soft toothbrush with a small smear of fluoride toothpaste is all you need in the beginning. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry also recommends scheduling a dental visit for your child by their first birthday. If a tooth seems delayed, or one falls out much earlier than what’s considered normal, your child’s pediatric dentist can ensure everything is still on track and no underlying issues are present.

Remember, every child’s timeline is unique, so don’t be alarmed if your little one’s teeth don’t come in or fall behind sooner or later than average. That said, knowing what to expect can help you and your child successfully navigate the whole teething process, from baby to adult teeth!
