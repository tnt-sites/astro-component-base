Has your child been complaining about sensitive teeth, or have you noticed a small hole in one of their teeth? If so, it is likely that they have a cavity. Initially, you might be tempted not to do anything about it. After all, baby teeth are designed to fall out anyway. You could reason that they do not need fillings. But that type of thinking is unwise. All cavities, including the ones that develop in baby teeth, should be assessed by a dentist. This blog post explains why that is the case. It also talks about potential [treatment options](https://www.bloomkidsdentist.com/restorative-care.html).

## The Importance of Treating Decay in Baby Teeth

Even though baby teeth are not meant to stay in the mouth forever, they _do_ have an important purpose. Failing to treat decay in these teeth might lead to some very serious consequences, including:

 * **Dental sensitivity and pain.** These problems might adversely affect your child’s behavior both at school and at home.
 * **Eating problems.** Your child might refuse to eat certain foods that exacerbate their discomfort, including nutritious items like fruits and veggies.
 * **Infections.** Severe decay increases the risk of a dental infection, which could invade nearby tissues and even cause systemic illness.
 * **Early loss of baby teeth.** In some cases, severe decay makes it necessary to remove a tooth. Early loss of baby teeth can adversely impact the development of incoming adult teeth.

## Treatment Options for Cavities in Baby Teeth

The best way to treat cavities in baby teeth depends on the specifics of each patient’s unique situation. Depending on the severity of the cavity and other factors, your child’s dentist might recommend:

 * **Oral hygiene adjustments.** If a cavity is still quite small, and the tooth is likely to come out on its own within 6 - 12 months, your child’s dentist might recommend that you are extra-diligent about your child’s oral hygiene. This may stop the progression of the decay and prevent the need for a filling.
 * **A filling.** Most pediatric dentists offer tooth-colored fillings that blend in beautifully with the surrounding enamel. They are also free of mercury and other toxic materials. This is the most common way to treat cavities in both baby teeth and permanent teeth.
 * **A crown.** If the decay is advanced, a filling might not be adequate to address it. Instead, your child might need a crown to completely cover the tooth. It can restore the tooth’s function while preventing additional damage.
 * **Extraction.** In some cases, there is no viable option except to remove a decayed tooth. If that is necessary for your child, your dentist may recommend that they receive a space maintainer in order to preserve the spot where the permanent tooth that will eventually erupt.

Cavities in baby teeth are nothing to take lightly! Make sure your child receives proper care from a dentist so they can avoid unnecessary pain and other complications.
