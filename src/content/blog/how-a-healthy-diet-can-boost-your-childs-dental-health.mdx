When it comes to [your child's dental health,](https://www.bloomkidsdentist.com/preventive-dentistry.html) brushing and flossing are only part of the picture; a healthy diet also plays a big role in building strong teeth, fighting off cavities, and supporting long-term oral health. The foods your child eats can either help protect their smile - or contribute to tooth decay and other dental issues. With that in mind, here’s a closer look at some of the best foods you can encourage your child to eat for the benefit of their dental wellness!

## The Importance of a Healthy Diet & How It Impacts Dental Hygiene

Teeth need essential nutrients like calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D, and others to grow strong and stay protected - this is the case for both baby teeth as well as permanent teeth. Sugary snacks and drinks normally do not contain substantial amounts of these beneficial nutrients; however, what’s worse is that they instead feed harmful bacteria in the mouth, leading to plaque buildup and tooth decay, as well as other issues like gum disease. Simply put, when your child consumes a diet high in sugar and low in nutrients, their teeth are weaker, meaning they’re extra vulnerable to dental issues.

## Healthy, Smile-Friendly Foods Your Child Will Love

The good news is that there are plenty of tasty, kid-friendly foods that can actually help protect your child’s teeth. Here are a few great options:

 * Cheese, yogurt, milk, and other dairy products that are high in calcium can strengthen tooth enamel.
 * Crunchy fruits and vegetables like apples, carrots, and celery can stimulate saliva flow and help clean the teeth.
 * Leafy greens like spinach and kale are loaded with calcium and other smile-friendly vitamins. You can try blending these and mixing them in with other foods if your child isn’t a fan.
 * Nuts and seeds are packed with protein, as well as magnesium and phosphorus that can help fortify enamel.
 * Water is by far the best beverage for your dental health; it provides hydration and can naturally rinse out food debris from between the teeth. Plus, it also stimulates saliva flow, which assists with cavity protection.

When you’re grocery shopping and cooking for your child, be sure that you’re reading nutrition labels so you can make choices that aren’t just low in sugar, but also high in beneficial vitamins and minerals. It’s just one of the many ways you can help set your child up for a lifetime of happy, healthy smiling!
