Between busy school schedules, after-school activities, and the occasional resistance to brushing and flossing, keeping your child’s oral health on track can sometimes feel like a challenge, to say the least! However, building good dental habits early on sets the stage for a lifetime of happy, healthy smiling--and it’s easier than you might think if you have a good plan in place. Here are some things [your child's dentist](https://www.bloomkidsdentist.com/preventive-dentistry.html) wants you to keep in mind when it comes to brushing and caring for children’s teeth.

## Start Brushing Your Baby’s Teeth as Soon as They Come In

Did you know that it’s a good idea to start brushing your child’s teeth as soon as they begin coming in? You can even begin earlier than this by gently cleaning their gums using a damp washcloth after feeding sessions to prevent bacterial growth. When teeth begin to poke through, you can start using a baby toothbrush and a tiny, rice-sized amount of fluoride toothpaste.

## Educate Them on Why Brushing Matters

Some parents wonder, why bother brushing baby teeth that are destined to fall out later on? The truth is, baby teeth are incredibly important, and without them, the permanent teeth would run into all kinds of issues. It’s not always easy to express this idea to children, but try your best to explain how healthy teeth will help them avoid getting sick or experiencing painful dental problems. If they can understand the reasoning behind why daily oral hygiene is important, they’ll carry those habits with them as they grow older.

## Teach Children the Proper Brushing Technique

Your child likely watches everything you do very closely--so you can use this to your advantage and show them how to properly brush their teeth, from start to finish. Show them how to apply toothpaste, exaggerate your brushing movements, and really demonstrate how to clean every part of your mouth. Stand there in the bathroom and brush with them, and don’t feel like there’s anything that isn’t worth explaining. If they’re still not able to brush properly on their own, you can step in and help them.

## Let Them Choose Their Toothbrush

Kids are often rebellious, and they don’t always like being told what to do--but you can accommodate this by allowing them to pick out their own toothbrush, toothpaste, and other oral hygiene products! There are many kid-friendly brushes that are marketed towards children; some are colorful, some play music, but _all_ are effective at clearing away cavity-causing bacteria. The bottom line is, getting children involved in something as simple as picking out a toothbrush can help them feel more inclined to use it.

While it’s not always easy to keep your child on top of their oral health, small, consistent efforts can go a long way. Keeping their habits in check and helping them as needed can set them up for a future of bright, confident smiling.
