Static sites should deploy like static sites. This starter builds to plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—no server runtime, no database, no special hosting requirements. That simplicity means you're not locked into any particular platform or service.

The build process is straightforward: run the build command, get a folder of static files. No complex configuration, no environment variables to manage, no database migrations to run. Just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that work anywhere.

Deploy to CloudCannon. Since everything is pre-rendered at build time, you don't need server-side processing. Upload the files, point your domain, and you're live.

The build is fast because there's no runtime to bundle, no database to query, no API calls to make. Everything is already compiled and ready to serve. A typical build takes seconds, not minutes.

The output is simple because it's just files. No hidden dependencies, no magic happening behind the scenes. You can inspect every file, understand what's being served, and debug issues without digging through layers of abstraction.

No server costs, no database costs, no compute costs. Just storage and bandwidth. That's how it should be.
