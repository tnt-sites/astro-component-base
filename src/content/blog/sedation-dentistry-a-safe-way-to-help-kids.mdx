It’s completely normal for children to feel nervous about visiting the dentist, especially if they need a procedure like a filling or an extraction, or anything else that might make them feel a little anxious. This is where [sedation dentistry](https://www.bloomkidsdentist.com/sedation-dentistry.html) comes in handy--often thought of as “dentistry on easy mode,” it’s a safe and suitable solution for children of all ages that can ensure a pleasant and positive experience in the treatment chair. Here’s what you need to know.

## What Exactly Is Sedation Dentistry?

Sedation dentistry uses medication to help children feel calm, comfortable, and less anxious staring did on procedures. It’s especially helpful for children who have dental anxiety or fear, have trouble sitting in the chair for long periods, have a strong gag reflex, or need extensive dental work or have other special healthcare needs.

Keep in mind that sedation dentistry doesn’t put your child to sleep, although it does instill deep feelings of relaxation that allow their dentist to comfortably complete a wide variety of treatments.

There are different methods used to achieve this, including:

 * **Nitrous Oxide Sedation** , commonly known as laughing gas, is breathed in through a soft nasal mask with a mixture of oxygen. It instills feelings of warmth and euphoria, but despite its nickname, your child shouldn't start laughing uncontrollably.
 * **Oral Conscious Sedation** , which is accomplished by a prescribed pill taken prior to the appointment, so that by the time your child is seated, they’re completely relaxed.
 * **IV Sedation** , which involves medication that’s administered intravenously, and is usually reserved for the most extreme cases of anxiety, as well as complex procedures.

## Is Sedation Dentistry Safe for Kids?

The bottom line is yes, when provided by a trained pediatric dental team, sedation dentistry is perfectly safe for children. And remember, your child’s safety is their dentist’s top priority, so they’ll always carefully review their medical records and history to ensure that they’re a suitable candidate. They’ll also explain every step of the process to you, as well as ensure that your child is closely monitored during every moment they’re sedated.

With so many perks for your child to experience, including reduced dental fear, treatment compliance, and a more positive outlook toward future dental visits, sedation dentistry is a safe and suitable solution that virtually all children can benefit from.
