Dental anxiety is common among children, and in many cases, it can interfere with their ability to receive necessary treatment. This is where [sedation dentistry](https://www.bloomkidsdentist.com/sedation-dentistry.html) comes into play; it can be a safe and effective solution for helping young patients feel calm and comfortable during dental procedures. That said, you might have questions when it comes to two of the most commonly used sedation options: laughing gas (nitrous oxide) and oral conscious sedation. Here's a closer look at each of them and some of their kid-friendly benefits.

## What Is Laughing Gas?

Laughing gas is a mild sedative inhaled through a small mask placed over your child’s nose with a mixture of oxygen. It helps to reduce anxiety and create a feeling of euphoria and relaxation without putting your child to sleep. Laughing gas takes effect within minutes, and it wears off quickly once the mask is removed, ensuring no lasting or lingering effects. It is often recommended for children with mild dental anxiety or for procedures that are relatively short and uncomplicated, such as cleanings, sealants, or fillings.

## How Does Oral Conscious Sedation Work?

Oral conscious sedation involves administering prescribed medication, usually a pill, before the procedure to help your child feel calm, relaxed, and a little drowsy during their appointment. However, they should still remain entirely conscious and able to respond to verbal and physical cues, though they may not remember much about the appointment afterward. Compared to laughing gas, this level of relaxation is deeper, making it more suited for longer or more complex procedures.

## Is One Option Better Than the Other?

You’ll be happy to hear that both laughing gas and oral conscious sedation are considered safe and effective when administered by trained professionals. Whichever is used depends on the nature of your child’s appointment and treatment plan, as well as their specific needs - and all of this will always be carefully weighed by their dentist.

Remember, the goal of using sedation is always centered around creating a positive dental experience that reduces fear, builds trust, and supports long-term oral health. That said, whichever route is chosen is certain to be effective and foster good feelings about dental care!
