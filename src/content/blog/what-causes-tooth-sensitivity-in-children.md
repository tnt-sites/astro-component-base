It’s not unusual for children to experience tooth sensitivity--they might express their discomfort while biting into an ice cream cone or taking a long drink from an ice-cold beverage. It can also happen due to hot items! But if this discomfort occurs frequently, it may be a sign of an underlying issue. The good news is that it’s something your child’s [pediatric dentist](https://www.bloomkidsdentist.com/minimally-invasive-dentistry.html) can help with; here’s what you need to know. 

## 5 Common Causes of Tooth Sensitivity in Children

 1. **Enamel Erosion** - Children have naturally thinner enamel than adults, making their teeth more vulnerable to wear, especially if they frequently consume acidic foods and drinks like orange juice, soda, and sports or energy drinks. Since the nerve will have less protection as the enamel wears away, the sensitive nerve will be more exposed.
 2. **Cavities** - A cavity creates a small opening in the enamel, exposing the more sensitive parts of the tooth that lie beneath. Even early-stage cavities can cause sharp or lingering sensitivity, especially when eating cold or sweet foods.
 3. **New Tooth Eruption** - When baby or permanent teeth erupt, the surrounding gums can feel tender or swollen; however, this sensitivity is temporary and natural.
 4. **Gum Recession** - This issue tends to be less common in children than adults, but hard brushing habits, bruxism, and gum disease can cause recession that exposes sensitive tooth roots.
 5. **Cracked or Chipped Teeth** - Even small cracks or chips can allow air and bacteria into the inner, sensitive layers of the tooth. Temperature changes are also felt more intensely in these injuries.

## How Pediatric Dentists Can Treat Tooth Sensitivity

Fortunately, there are a few ways that pediatric dentists can effectively treat tooth sensitivity. If decay is the cause, they can restore the tooth--and once the cavity is gone, the sensitivity usually goes away. Fluoride treatments can also strengthen enamel and protect the teeth from sensitivity and decay by ensuring the delicate nerve endings aren’t exposed. Desensitizing toothpaste is another effective option that’s safe for children for the same reason; stronger enamel leads to less sensitivity.

If your child is avoiding certain foods, experiencing discomfort while brushing, or complaining about constant pain, it’s time to speak with their dentist. Tooth sensitivity isn’t just uncomfortable; it can mean a tooth needs attention. Thankfully, the solution is usually very straightforward!
