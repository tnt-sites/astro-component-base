Halloween is one of the most fun times of the year for kids, with costumes, candy, and spooky fun everywhere! For you, it’s also a great opportunity to capture your little one’s pearly whites for your family album. Whether they want to be a superhero or a classic creature, here are some kid-friendly costume ideas that will let [your child's smile](https://www.bloomkidsdentist.com/dentistry-for-children.html) steal the spotlight this Halloween.

## A Friendly Vampire

Vampires are known for their impressive fangs, but friendly vampires are famous for their happy grins and their sweet tooth. If your child wants to transform into a creature of the not-so-dark night, you can help them easily. Find a cape, a dark pair of pants, a tuxedo shirt, some white skin-safe makeup, and plastic fangs. With this ensemble, every time they smile, their costume will come to life!

## A Grinning Ghost

Not all ghosts have to be spooky! Turn your child into a grinning ghost-with-the-most who lights up the room with a smile. A simple white sheet with eye and mouth cutouts paired with an LED trick-or-treat bucket or some glowsticks is all you’ll need. Not only will this last-minute costume let them smile unobstructed, but it will also keep them visible while they’re haunting the neighborhood.

## A Smiling Superhero

Kids love dressing up as superheroes, and what better power to highlight than a dazzling grin? Let your child pick out a solid-colored shirt and pants while you find a sheet for a cape. If they want to wear a mask, let them make one out of cardboard and help them decorate it!

Last, but not least, help them make an emblem for their shirt out of cardstock. With this creative costume, they’ll love pretending to save the day, all while showing off their smile!

## A Happy Clown

Is there anything happier than a clown? After all, they’re known for their big smiles! With some bright face paint, colorful clothes, and a funny red nose, they’ll be the brightest clown with the nicest smile in town!

While you could spring for a pre-made costume from a big box store, there’s something magical about making your own. So, this Halloween, give your child’s imagination a workout. Whether they go for something spooky, mystical, or silly, their grin will make every costume even more fun!
