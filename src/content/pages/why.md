    heading: Why build another Astro component library?
    subtext: >-
      We're big fans of the static web. And we love what the Astro team is
      making! As more <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/partner-program/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">partner agencies</a> are building client
      sites on CloudCannon, we wanted to provide a component library for Astro
      that outputs static HTML and CSS, for the fastest delivery possible
      —&nbsp;all unbranded and adaptable for any project.

        title: High performance
        description: >-
          Great performance starts with what you choose not to load. This
          component library keeps everything lean with simple HTML, CSS, and
          vanilla JavaScript, plus built-in tools that squeeze every drop of
          performance out of your images.

        description: >-
          Maintaining a site is easier when the pieces stay small and
          predictable. With this component library, you build on top of highly
          polished building blocks that stay clear, focused, and easy to work
          with as your site grows.

          Teams move faster when everything feels obvious. Clear names, simple
          patterns, and a consistent structure mean anyone can open the project
          and immediately know where things live and how they work.

              We give you [straightforward building blocks](/component-library/)
              without hiding anything behind layers of abstraction. You see
              everything that's happening, and stay in control.

              Lean HTML, CSS, and small touches of vanilla JavaScript. No dead
              weight, no surprise dependencies, just the pieces you actually
              need to build great pages.

              Performance comes from keeping things lightweight. The framework
              handles image optimization and responsive patterns so your site
              stays quick without extra work.

            text: >-
              Every part of the component library is meant to be opened, read,
              and edited. You shape it to fit your project instead of working
              around someone else's opinions. Start by [browsing the
              components](/component-library/) to see how they're set up!
