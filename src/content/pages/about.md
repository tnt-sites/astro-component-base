      Imagine scheduling your child’s dental appointment, and instead of feeling
      nervous, you can breathe a sigh of relief. You know that your child will
      be treated wonderfully, the staff will make them feel special, and they
      will always receive fully tailored care that is perfectly suited to their
      age, needs, and personality. That’s the type of experience we offer here
      at Bloom Pediatric Dentistry. Dr. Nelson, Dr. JoJo, and the rest of our
      team want the time you spend in our Murphy pediatric office to be a
      welcome break from the rest of your day that results in your child having
      a bright, healthy, and confident smile.
